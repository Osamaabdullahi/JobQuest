# Conduit Core Domain

Conduit is a Django REST API that serves weather telemetry data from physical weather stations (IoT/AWS — Automatic Weather Stations). It exposes current readings, historical timelines, daily summaries, and heat-stress safety alerts (based on WBGT and Heat Index), and it secures access using both JWT user accounts and per-application API keys with rate limiting.

This README is meant to get a new collaborator from "cloned the repo" to "understands the whole API surface" without having to read every file.

## 1. Tech Stack

- **Python / Django 6.0** — core framework
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** — API layer
- **djangorestframework-simplejwt** — JWT auth for human users (login/signup)
- **django-cors-headers** — CORS handling (currently `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True`, dev-only)
- **SQLite** (`db.sqlite3`) — default dev database
- **pandas / numpy / openpyxl** — used for data import/aggregation tooling

> **Note on `ingestion`:** This app is currently just a Django scaffold (no models, no views, not wired into `urls.py`). The actual data-loading happens via a **management command**: `telemetry/management/commands/import_geocsv.py`, which imports historical measurements from a JSON file into a given `WeatherStation`. If you're building out a real ingestion pipeline (e.g. live device push), that's the natural place to do it — either flesh out `ingestion` or extend this command.

## 3. Core Domain Concepts

| Model | App | What it represents |
|---|---|---|
| `User` | accounts | A human account (email + username login). UUID primary key. |
| `APIKey` | accounts | A machine credential tied to a user, used to call the telemetry API. Has its own rate limits. |
| `APIRequestLog` | accounts | One row per authenticated API-key request, used to enforce rate limits. |
| `WeatherStation` | telemetry | A physical weather station (location, instrument name, status, slug). |
| `WeatherMeasurement` | telemetry | A single sensor reading from a station at a point in time (temp, humidity, wind, rain, light, battery health, etc). |
| `WeatherAlert` | telemetry | A heat-stress risk alert (`info` / `warning` / `danger` / `extreme`), auto-generated whenever a measurement is saved. |

### Auto-generated alerts (important behavior)

Every time a `WeatherMeasurement` is saved (via API, admin, script, fixture — doesn't matter how), a Django signal (`telemetry/signals.py`) automatically:

1. Computes severity from `wbgt` and `heat_index` using banded thresholds (`telemetry/severity.py`).
2. Creates a corresponding `WeatherAlert` row with a human-readable message.

So you never create `WeatherAlert` objects directly — they're a derived, automatic side-effect of recording a measurement.

Severity bands (whichever is more severe of the two wins):

| Severity | WBGT ≥ | Heat Index ≥ |
|---|---|---|
| Extreme | 31.0 | 51.0 |
| Danger | 29.0 | 39.0 |
| Warning | 27.0 | 32.0 |
| Info (safe) | below all thresholds | below all thresholds |

## 4. Authentication

There are **two separate auth mechanisms** depending on who's calling:

### A. Human users — JWT (for managing accounts / API keys)

Standard email+password login issuing JWT access/refresh tokens (`rest_framework_simplejwt`). Used only for the `accounts` endpoints below (signup, login, managing your own API keys) — **not** for the telemetry data endpoints.

- Access token lifetime: 30 minutes
- Refresh token lifetime: 7 days

### B. Machine / app clients — API Key (for reading telemetry data)

All `telemetry` endpoints require an **API key**, sent via header:

```
X-API-KEY: <your-key>
```

This is implemented in `accounts/authentication.py` (`APIKeyAuthentication`) and enforces, on every request:

1. The key exists and `is_active=True` (otherwise: `401 Invalid API key`).
2. **Per-minute rate limit** — based on `APIKey.requests_per_minute` (default 60).
3. **Daily quota** — based on `APIKey.daily_quota` (default 10,000).
4. Logs the request to `APIRequestLog` for rate-limit accounting.

If either limit is exceeded, the request is rejected with `401` and a message (`Rate limit exceeded (per minute)` / `Daily quota exceeded`).

> To get a key: sign up → log in → call the API-key creation endpoint (requires JWT auth, see below).

## 5. API Reference

Base URL: `/api/v1/`

### 5.1 Auth & Account Management — `/api/v1/auth/` (JWT-protected, except signup/login)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/signup/` | — | Create a new user account (`email`, `username`, `password`) |
| POST | `/auth/login/` | — | Log in, returns JWT `access` + `refresh` tokens |
| POST | `/auth/refresh/` | — | Exchange a refresh token for a new access token |
| GET | `/auth/me/` | JWT | Get the current logged-in user's profile |
| GET | `/auth/api-keys/` | JWT | List your API keys |
| POST | `/auth/api-keys/create/` | JWT | Create a new API key (optionally named) |
| DELETE | `/auth/api-keys/<id>/` | JWT | Revoke/delete an API key |

### 5.2 Weather Telemetry — `/api/v1/` (API Key required, header `X-API-KEY`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/stations/` | List all weather stations (unpaginated) |
| GET | `/stations/<slug>/` | Get details of a single station |
| GET | `/stations/current/` | Current/latest reading for **every active station** (global snapshot) |
| GET | `/stations/<slug>/current/` | Current/latest reading for a single station |
| GET | `/stations/<slug>/timeline/?resolution=hourly` | Bucketed time-series of recent readings. `resolution` ∈ `minutely` (last 1h) / `hourly` (last 24h) / `daily` (last 30d) |
| GET | `/stations/<slug>/summary/` | Daily aggregated summary (max/min/avg temp, avg humidity, total rain) for the last 30 days |
| GET | `/stations/<slug>/history/?start_date=&end_date=` | Paginated raw measurement history (filterable by date range) |
| GET | `/stations/alerts/current/` | Latest alert per active station |
| GET | `/stations/<slug>/alerts/` | Paginated alert history for a single station |

**Pagination** (on `/history/` and `/alerts/` for a station): standard DRF page-number pagination — `?page=1&page_size=100` (default page size 100, max 1000).

## 7. Response Shape Notes

- `current` / `history` endpoints return measurements grouped into nested objects: `system_health`, `weather_readings` (with sub-groups `temperature`, `light`, `rain`, `wind`, `indices`). This is a deliberately "tidy" API shape — the flat DB columns are reorganized by the serializers (`telemetry/serializers.py`), they aren't 1:1 with the model fields.
- `timeline` and `summary` return **derived/aggregated** values (averages, max, totals) computed in `telemetry/aggregation.py` — not raw rows.
- Temperature in aggregates falls back across sensors in this order: `bmx_temperature` → `mcp_temperature` → `sht_temperature` (first non-null wins).
- Rain totals fall back: `rain_gauge_1` → `rain_gauge_2` per row, then summed.

## 8. Local Setup

```bash
cd config
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # or your preferred env tool
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser   # optional, for /admin/
python manage.py runserver
```

Admin site: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

To bulk-import historical measurements from a JSON file into an existing station:
```bash
python manage.py import_geocsv <path_to_json> <station_id>
```

## 9. Things to Know / Gotchas for Contributors

- `DEBUG = True` and `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded in `settings.py` — **must be changed before any production deployment.**
- `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True` is also dev-only; lock this down for prod.
- `ingestion` app exists but is unused scaffolding — don't expect logic there yet.
- Alerts are *read-only and automatic* — there's no endpoint to create/edit them; they're a side-effect of saving a `WeatherMeasurement`.
- `IsReadOnlyOrAdmin` permission class exists in `telemetry/permissions.py` but isn't currently applied to any view — all telemetry views currently require API-key auth for both reads, with no public/anonymous access yet.
- `APIKeyDeleteView` URL pattern uses `<int:pk>` but `APIKey.id` is a UUID — worth double-checking/fixing if key deletion isn't working as expected.
